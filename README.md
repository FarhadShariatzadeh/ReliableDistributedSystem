## Reliable-Distributed-System

This is a TCP-IP client/server key-value store which supports replication and node discovery. Any new server node logs its port and IP address to a membership directory once it is initialized. Serve nodes are receiving the most update copy of membership directory every a few seconds. Any server node can send requests to all available servers in the network using the membership directory. Replication is implemented using a two-phase-commit approach. Every TCP server maintains an active copy of the node membership directory. Client can send request to any available server node in the system. A server node which receives a request from the client is considered as a "Leader" node. The Leader node goes through the membership directory and checks to see if all the available server nodes are ready to received the request. Once the leader node receives "Acknowledgement" message from all other server nodes, the leader node implement the client-request on its key-value store and send the same request to all other servers.
